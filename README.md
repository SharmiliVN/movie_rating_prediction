Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting movie ratings based on various features. By analyzing a dataset of movie attributes and their corresponding ratings, the model will learn patterns and relationships that can be used to predict ratings for new, unseen movies.

Dataset

Source: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies]
Description: The dataset should include features such as:
Movie title
Genre
Director
Cast
Release year
Runtime
Keywords
Ratings (target variable)
Data Preprocessing

Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance. 
Model Selection and Training

Algorithm Choice: 

Consider various algorithms suitable for regression tasks, such as:
Linear regression
Random forest
Gradient boosting
Support vector machines
Neural networks

Model Evaluation: 
Use appropriate metrics like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters to achieve the best results.
Deployment

Packaging: 
Create a deployable package or container for the trained model.
Integration: 
Integrate the model into a web application, API, or other relevant platform.
Usage

Input: 
Provide the model with the necessary features of a new movie (e.g., title, genre, director).
Output:
The model will predict a rating for the movie based on its learned patterns.

Future Work::

Feature Engineering: 
Explore additional features that might improve model accuracy.
Ensemble Methods: 
Combine multiple models to enhance performance.
Deep Learning: 
Experiment with deep learning architectures for more complex relationships.
Real-time Predictions: 
Integrate the model into a real-time system for immediate rating predictions.
